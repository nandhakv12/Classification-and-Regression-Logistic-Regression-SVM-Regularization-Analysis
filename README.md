# Classification and Regression: Logistic Regression, SVM & Regularization Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements **One-vs-All Logistic Regression, Multi-Class Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** to analyze classification performance on the **MNIST dataset**. The study focuses on **accuracy, per-class error rates, generalization performance, and hyperparameter tuning** (e.g., regularization parameter C, SVM kernel selection). The impact of overfitting and underfitting is explored.

## Key Features
- **One-vs-All vs. Multi-Class Logistic Regression**: Compare accuracy and error rates for both strategies.
- **SVM with Linear & RBF Kernels**: Evaluate kernel performance for handwritten digit classification.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize SVM regularization parameter (C) and kernel settings.
- **Generalization Analysis**: Compare training, validation, and testing accuracy.
